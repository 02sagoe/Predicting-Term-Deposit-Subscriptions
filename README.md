# Predicting-Term-Deposit-Subscriptions

This project aims to predict whether a client will subscribe to a term deposit based on features derived from marketing campaign data. It includes model training, evaluation, feature importance analysis, and actionable insights for the marketing team.


## Dataset Description
The dataset is related to direct marketing campaigns of a banking institution. The goal is to predict if a client will subscribe (yes) or not (no) to a term deposit (y).

Features :

`age` (numeric)

`job` : type of job (categorical: "admin", "unknown", "unemployed", "management", "housemaid", "entrepreneur", "student", "blue-collar", "self-employed", "retired", "technician", "services") 

`marital` : marital status (categorical: "married","divorced","single"; note: "divorced" means divorced or widowed)

`education` (categorical: "unknown","secondary","primary","tertiary")

`default`: has credit in default? (binary: "yes","no")

`balance`: average yearly balance, in euros (numeric) 

`housing`: has housing loan? (binary: "yes","no")

`loan`: has personal loan? (binary: "yes","no")

`contact`: contact communication type (categorical: "unknown","telephone","cellular") 

`day`: last contact day of the month (numeric)

`month`: last contact month of year (categorical: "jan", "feb", "mar", ..., "nov", "dec")

`duration`: last contact duration, in seconds (numeric)

`campaign`: number of contacts performed during this campaign and for this client (numeric, includes last contact)

`pdays`: number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric, -1 means client was not previously contacted)

`previous`: number of contacts performed before this campaign and for this client (numeric)

`poutcome`: outcome of the previous marketing campaign (categorical: "unknown","other","failure","success")


Target Variable : `y â€“ binary classification (yes / no)`
